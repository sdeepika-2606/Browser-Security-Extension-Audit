# Browser Extension Security Risks

## 🛑 Why Browser Extensions Can Be Dangerous

1. **Overreaching Permissions**
   - Some extensions ask for access to all your browsing data, clipboard, or even file systems.

2. **Malware and Adware Injection**
   - Malicious extensions can inject ads, track users, or redirect traffic to malicious sites.

3. **Password Theft**
   - If improperly sandboxed, extensions may read form fields including login credentials.

4. **Poor Developer Trust**
   - Extensions from unknown developers with limited reviews are more likely to be harmful.

5. **Auto Updates Risks**
   - Developers can push malicious code through an update even after being initially safe.

## 🔐 Best Practices

- Install extensions only from verified sources.
- Always check user reviews and permission requests.
- Periodically audit your installed extensions.
- Remove unused or unknown extensions immediately.

Stay safe online!
